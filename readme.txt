prompt Shortener

Introduction

This is a Python script that uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate shorter versions of input prompts while preserving important information. The script uses the spaCy library to perform NLP tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and named entity recognition.
Installation
To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You'll also need to install the spaCy library and download the appropriate language model


Usage
To use the script, simply run the generate_shorter_prompt function with an input prompt as the argument. The function will return a shorter version of the prompt that preserves important information.

Working

we're using the English language model for spaCy (en_core_web_sm) to preprocess text and generate a shorter prompt. The preprocess_text function and generate_shorter_prompt function are used to generate a shorter version of the input prompt that preserves important information.
The preprocess_text function takes a string of text as input and returns a list of lemmatized tokens. The generate_shorter_prompt function takes an input prompt as a string and uses spaCy to identify important phrases in the prompt, such as noun chunks and named entities. It then preprocesses these phrases using the preprocess_text function and generates a shorter prompt by combining the preprocessed phrases.



why me??
There are several ways in which this prompt shortener may be better than other prompt shorteners:

1. Preserves important information: This prompt shortener uses natural language processing to identify important phrases in the input prompt and preserve them in the shortened version. This ensures that the shortened prompt still contains the most important information from the original prompt.

2. Uses lemmatization: The script uses lemmatization to preprocess the text before generating the shortened prompt. This helps to ensure that the same concepts are represented consistently throughout the text, which can improve the accuracy of the shortened prompt.

3. Open-source: This prompt shortener is open-source, which means that anyone can contribute to the code and help to improve it over time. This can lead to a more robust and effective prompt shortener in the long run.

4. Customizable: The script can be easily customized to suit different use cases and requirements. For example, users can modify the code to include additional rules for identifying important phrases or to use a different NLP library if desired.

Overall, this prompt shortener offers a combination of accuracy, flexibility, and open-source collaboration that may make it a better choice than other prompt shorteners for some users.
